Feature: Session restore
  Terminals and their CWDs are saved automatically. When kolu starts
  with no terminals, the empty state offers to restore the previous session.

  Scenario: Restore previous session from empty state
    # Seed a known session on the server (no timing dependency on auto-save)
    Given a saved session with 2 terminals
    When I open the app
    Then the session restore card should be visible
    And the restore button should mention "2 terminals"
    When I click the restore button
    Then there should be 2 sidebar entries
    And there should be no page errors
