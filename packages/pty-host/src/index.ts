/** `@kolu/pty-host` — the PTY-owner primitive, its wire contract, and the
 *  in-process serving of that contract.
 *
 *  - `createPtyHost` — the **primitive**: a `node-pty` child + an
 *    `@xterm/headless` screen mirror + the VT-derived event taps (cwd via
 *    OSC 7, title via OSC 0/2, command-run via OSC 633, foreground via
 *    `tcgetpgrp`, exit), fanned out through a bounded per-PTY channel. Owns
 *    ONLY the PTY — no git, PRs, agents, file tree, or transport. It takes a
 *    fully-prepared spawn (env/shell-init is the caller's job — `kolu-pty`).
 *  - `ptyHostSurface` — the typed **contract** (the `PtyHost` interface
 *    projected onto a wire) + its version + compatibility check.
 *  - `servePtyHost` — the contract's **serving**, transport-agnostic: prepares
 *    the shell env and serves `ptyHostSurface` over `createPtyHost`, returning
 *    the router (+ ctx). Reused over a socket by the surviving daemon and over
 *    ssh by R-2 — only the link differs.
 *  - `createInProcessPtyHostClient` — the **identity link**: `directLink` over
 *    `servePtyHost`'s router with no transport, handing back a contract-typed
 *    client. The consumer (kolu-server) is invariant under a later link swap.
