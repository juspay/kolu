/**
 * Agent CLI command detection and normalization.
 *
 * When the user runs a known agent binary in any kolu terminal
 * (`claude`, `aider`, `opencode`, etc.), kolu's preexec hook emits
 * the raw command line as an `OSC 633 ; E ; <cmd>` mark on the PTY
 * output stream. `parseAgentCommand` takes that raw string and
 * returns a normalized canonical form, or `null` if the command
 * is not a known agent invocation.
 *
 * Normalization rules:
 * - First token (basename-stripped) must be in `STABLE_FLAGS`.
 * - Commands containing exit-immediately flags (`--version`, `--help`,
 *   `-V`, `-h`) return `null` — they are not agent sessions.
 * - Only flags listed in `STABLE_FLAGS` (per agent) are preserved.
 *   Unknown flags are dropped by default — safe by construction.
 *   This is an allowlist, not a denylist: adding a new agent CLI flag
 *   upstream cannot silently pollute the MRU; it is dropped until
 *   someone adds it to the allowlist.
 * - Trailing positional arguments (after the last flag) are stripped
 *   so `aider src/foo.ts` collapses to `aider`.
 *
 * Tokenization delegates to `string-argv`, a small focused library
 * for splitting shell-like strings into argv. We don't try to evaluate
 * the command — we only need to decide which tokens to strip — so the
 * tokenizer's exact handling of edge cases (command substitution,
 * process substitution, glob) doesn't matter: unknown constructs fall
 * through as opaque positionals and get dropped in the same step that
 * drops real positionals.

 * Each marker is spliced into the command as a RAW string (not re-quoted argv),
 * so a multi-word marker like `resume --last` works as written; the tokens are
 * plain flags/identifiers with no shell-significant characters. `parseAgentCommand`
 * strips `-c`/`--continue`/`--resume`/`-r` during normalization (per
 * juspay/kolu#467), so the input is always resume-free — no idempotency case.
