/**
 * `TerminalEndpoint` — the per-terminal world a terminal lives in.
 *
 * Concretely, the endpoint owns: what process holds the PTY, what
 * filesystem the Code-tab reads, where the git watcher runs, where the
 * per-terminal providers (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, GitHub PR,
 * foreground process) observe their state. Every per-terminal stream
 * and every per-host one-shot fs/git op goes through this object.
 *
 * There is **one** endpoint shape, not a family of backends. An endpoint
 * is three surfaces — PTY · fs · git — **bound to a transport**:
 *
 *   - **Local** (today) — this kolu process. PTY spawned in-process via
 *     `node-pty`, providers watch local files via `@parcel/watcher`,
 *     fs/git ops shell out locally.
 *   - **Remote** (P3, kaval-sessions) — the *same* surfaces dialed over
 *     ssh to a kaval on another host; fs/git mirror over the `HostSession`
 *     link rather than shelling out here. Not a separate implementation
 *     class — the same shape, a different transport.
 *
 * The interface lives in `kolu-common` because downstream consumers
 * (router, surface, orchestrators) and P3's remote-endpoint impl share
 * the same shape. Consumers talk to `endpoint.X` and never ask "where
 * does this live?" — the binding to a host is the endpoint's own concern.
 *
 * ── Invariants ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. **Kill convergence.** `killTerminal(id)` is the sole termination
 *    path. `TerminalHandle` does NOT carry `dispose()` — handle-as-
 *    control-surface and kill-as-lifecycle are two distinct roles.
 *
 * 2. **The endpoint owns its filesystem.** `TerminalEndpointFs` /
 *    `TerminalEndpointGit` cover BOTH one-shot ops AND watcher
 *    subscriptions — same volatility axis ("where the FS lives"), one
 *    place the surfaces bind.
 *
 * 3. **Sync shadow entry, async I/O.** `spawnPty` registers a
 *    `TerminalProcess` entry synchronously (so the tile renders
 *    immediately), then any I/O happens on a later tick. The local
 *    endpoint's I/O is instantaneous so this is a no-op there; a remote
 *    endpoint (P3) will need minutes for cold `nix run` realisation and
 *    the contract is what makes the instant-tile UX work.
