/**
 * `createLiveSignal` — the single, UNFORGEABLE minter of a watchdog-backed
 * `LiveSignal`. It lives in `@kolu/surface` (beside the module-private brand
 * symbol), so `brandLiveSignal` is un-importable and a brand can only come from
 * here. Two things must hold, end-to-end:
 *
 *   1. Its output is BRANDED — `surfaceClient`/`surfaceClients` accept it over a
 *      half-openable `websocketLink` (where a bare `() => true` throws).
 *   2. The watchdog it wires is REAL and MANDATORY — there is no `heartbeat:false`
 *      to mint a blind brand, and a probe TIMEOUT drives the full chain
 *      `onStale → ws.reconnect() → close → status off "live"`, so `live()` flips
 *      false on a silently half-open socket WITHOUT any manual close. A `LiveSignal`
 *      existing is therefore PROOF a watchdog backs it, not a marker the guard trusts.
