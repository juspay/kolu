/**
 * `useCollection` — Solid hook for per-key reactive subscriptions over a
 * keyed server collection.
 *
 * The hook takes a reactive `keys` accessor — caller-provided so the keys
 * source can be anything (a server stream wrapped in createSubscription,
 * a derivation from a list-of-records subscription, a static array). Per-key
 * subscriptions are managed via `mapArray` so SolidJS handles the lifecycle:
 * when a key leaves the set, its reactive owner is disposed, the per-key
 * subscription's `onCleanup` fires, the AbortController aborts, and the
 * server stream tears down. No manual Map / version signals / abort plumbing
 * required at the call site.
 *
 * `valueSource` is a typed oRPC procedure ref (e.g.
 * `client.terminal.onMetadataChange`) plus a `keyToInput` adapter — the
 * input shape per key varies by procedure (some take `{ id }`, some take
 * `{ key }`, some take the raw key) and the framework can't guess. The
 * hook threads `STREAM_RETRY` context internally.
