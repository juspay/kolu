/**
 * `projectSurface` — derive a surface B from a live client of surface A.
 *
 * The wire links (`websocketLink`, `stdioLink`, `directLink`) move a surface
 * *across* a boundary. `projectSurface` does something orthogonal: it builds a
 * *new* surface (B) whose handlers are implemented by *consuming* an existing
 * surface (A) through a client. B is "a server that's a client" — its cells,
 * streams, and procedures are projections of A's, mapped on the fly.
 *
 * The canonical use is an adapter: A is the app's native reactive surface, B
 * is a foreign protocol's surface (an MCP server, a public read-only mirror, a
 * narrowed view for a less-trusted peer). B's handlers don't reimplement A's
 * state — they subscribe to A through an in-process `directLink` client and map
 * each frame. One source of truth (A), N projected faces (B…).
 *
 * Three derive helpers do the mapping, each preserving the matching primitive's
 * wire contract:
 *
 *   - `deriveCell`    — track an upstream A-cell (snapshot-then-deltas) and
 *                       republish `map(frame)` as B's own cell. Plugs into
 *                       `implementSurface`'s `cells.<key>` slot.
 *   - `deriveStream`  — subscribe an upstream async-iterable and map each
 *                       frame, preserving snapshot-then-deltas. Plugs into the
 *                       `streams.<key>` slot's `{ source }`.
 *   - `deriveEvent`   — same as `deriveStream` but with no snapshot obligation,
 *                       for the `events.<key>` slot.
 *
 * Teardown is the load-bearing detail: every helper threads B's abort signal
 * into A's client call and wraps the upstream iterator with `iterateUntilAborted`
 * so an abort-time rejection from A's iterator (the publisher rejects pending
 * pulls with `signal.reason` on shutdown) is swallowed rather than surfaced as
 * an unhandled rejection. Aborting a B subscription thus tears down the
 * matching A subscription with no leak and no noise.
