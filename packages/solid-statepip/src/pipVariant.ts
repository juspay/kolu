/** The status-pip vocabulary + the shared agent-paint → pip fold.
 *
 *  A `PipVariant` is the ONE render variant the `StatePip` component switches
 *  over — the cross-surface vocabulary kolu's on-canvas **Dock** and the
 *  **pulam-web** fleet dashboard both speak, so a given agent state renders the
 *  IDENTICAL pip (glyph · colour · animation) on both. `StatePip` lives here, in
 *  a presentation leaf both surfaces import, rather than in `dock/` where it
 *  used to — location is structure.
 *
 *  `pipForPaintClass` is the single definition of "which pip an agent's paint
 *  class shows", imported by BOTH the Dock's `pipVariant` and pulam-web's
 *  `pipVariantFor`, so the agent-paint → pip mapping can't be spelled — and
 *  drift — twice (the exact "defined twice → drifts" hazard R-pip-unify closes).
 *  Each surface layers only its OWN overlays on top: the Dock adds
 *  `unread`→attention, `parked`→empty and its deliberate `sleeping`; pulam-web
 *  adds structural sleeping (no agent + no foreground). Neither surface's local
 *  triage concepts leak in here. */

/** The shared agent-paint → pip fold. Speaks only the three agent paint classes
