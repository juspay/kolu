/** The shared status indicator — kolu's on-canvas **Dock** and the **pulam-web**
 *  fleet dashboard both render THIS component, so a given (state, live, alert)
 *  triple shows the identical glyph, colour, and animation on both surfaces.
 *  Shape carries the state distinction (hollow ring vs muted dot vs ☾) so the
 *  rule survives reduced colour sensitivity and a peripheral glance — not colour
 *  and animation alone.
 *
 *  Three nested axes in one glyph (R-activity-merge), so one look reads overall
 *  activity instead of scanning two or three separate dots:
 *    - `variant` (the CORE) — agent state, the precomputed `PipVariant`. Each
 *      surface owns its own state→variant mapping (the Dock's `pipVariant`,
 *      pulam-web's `pipVariantFor`), both folding the shared agent-paint classes
 *      through `pipForPaintClass`.
 *    - `live` (the RING) — this terminal is moving bytes right now (the old
 *      `LiveActivityDot`, folded into the indicator's green edge).
 *    - `alert` (the HALO) — a fired notification you haven't opened (the Dock's
 *      `unread`, pulam-web's notify-class). An amber halo wraps the whole thing
 *      while the state core stays visible underneath — needs-attention AND the
 *      live state at once, not a loud disk that hides the state.
 *
 *  Pure presentation: the per-variant CORE class set lives in `PIP_BODY` and the
 *  ring/halo class set in `indicatorWrapperClass`, both as data, so the agreed
 *  look is a single source pinned by a pure test (no DOM harness, matching the
 *  other `@kolu/solid-*` leaves). Colours are the shared `@kolu/theme` tokens, so
 *  both surfaces — which each `@import "@kolu/theme/theme.css"` — resolve them
 *  identically. */
