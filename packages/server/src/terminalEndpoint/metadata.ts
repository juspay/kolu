/**
 * Awareness + metadata write seam (Design-S) — the publishers and the two
 * narrowed awareness mutators, plus the client-field mutator and the lifecycle
 * publish.
 *
 * Design-S splits a terminal's record in two halves, BOTH carried by the one
 * registry entry: the eight AWARENESS fields ride `entry.awareness` (the sink is
 * the sole live writer, mutating it through the two narrowed mutators), and the
 * AUTHORED record (location + client fields + discriminant) rides `entry.meta`.
 * This module publishes each half on its
 * OWN collection — awareness onto `terminalWorkspace.awareness`, the authored
 * record onto `kolu.authored` — and the CLIENT joins them at read time
 * (`useTerminalMetadata` → `composeTerminalMetadata`). There is NO server-side
 * re-fusion here: this module owns "how an awareness write becomes visible" and
 * "how an authored / lifecycle flip becomes visible" as two separate publishes.
 *
 * The mutator-type narrowing is a bidirectional compile-time fence:
 *   - `updateServerMetadata` — persisted awareness (cwd, git, lastAgentCommand,
 *     agentSession, lastActivityAt). Mutator typed `AwarenessPersistedFields`.
 *     Fires `terminals:dirty`.
 *   - `updateServerLiveMetadata` — live awareness (pr, agent, foreground).
 *     Mutator typed `AwarenessLiveFields`. Does NOT fire `terminals:dirty` —
 *     that's the point: the agent stream publishes at ~150 ms during streaming,
 *     and most of those publishes touch only live state.
 *   - `updateClientMetadata` — client-persisted authored fields (themeName,
 *     parentId, canvasLayout, subPanel, rightPanel, intent). Mutator typed
 *     `TerminalClientMetadata`. Fires `terminals:dirty` (every client field is
 *     persisted).
 *
 * Both awareness mutators now key on the terminal ID (the sink closes over the
 * id); `entry.awareness` on the registry is where their writes land.
