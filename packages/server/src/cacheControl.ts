/**
 * HTTP `Cache-Control` policy for static assets. Pure path→directive map so
 * the server route file stays route-topology only.
 *
 * Four classes:
 * - Vite-hashed `/assets/*` — content-addressed, pinned `immutable` forever.
 * - The SPA shell (`/`, `/index.html`) — `no-store`. `no-cache` was not enough:
 *   a bare-hostname HTTP/PWA client (no service worker, so no Workbox) was
 *   observed replaying a STALE cached `index.html` on a *normal* reload — only a
 *   hard reload cleared it — pinning the app to an old bundle across deploys.
 *   `no-store` removes the entry entirely so a normal reload can never replay a
 *   stale shell. The shell is ~1 KB, refetched per navigation — negligible.
 * - Service-worker scripts (`/sw.js`, `/registerSW.js`, `workbox-*`) —
 *   `no-cache` so a deploy's new worker is picked up on first reload, while
 *   staying cacheable-but-revalidated so the SW byte-comparison update path
 *   keeps working on secure-context deploys.
 * - Everything else — no opinion, let the upstream default stand.
