/**
 * The **soul** of kolu's pty-host endpoint: the kaval-specific *values* the
 * survivable-spawn mechanism (the spine, `@kolu/surface-daemon-supervisor`)
 * takes as parameters. Everything host-platform-generic — the `INVOCATION_ID`
 * gate, `systemd-run --user`, the detached+unref fork, unique unit names — lives
 * in the spine's `survivableSpawnDriver`; this file only supplies what is
 * specific to *this* daemon: which binary, which args, which env, which unit
 * prefix, and where its socket + gate live.
 *
 * Binary resolution has two modes, the same closure either way:
 *   - **Production / nix** — `KOLU_KAVAL_BIN` points at the built `kaval`
 *     wrapper (`${kaval}/bin/kaval`, itself `node --import <tsx loader> bin.ts`).
 *     Spawn it directly with no leading args.
 *   - **Dev / e2e** — no wrapper exists, so reproduce its launcher shape from
 *     source: `node --import <tsx loader> packages/kaval/src/bin.ts`. The tsx
 *     loader is resolved through the package (not a hoisted `.bin` symlink),
 *     exactly as `socketDaemon.test.ts` does, so it works under `test-quick`.
 *
 * The dev-flag filter is by construction: kaval's argv is built fresh here, so
 * kolu's own `process.execArgv` (an `--inspect`, a heap-snapshot flag) never
 * propagates to the daemon; and `NODE_OPTIONS` is scrubbed of those same dev
 * flags before it reaches kaval, so a kolu launched with diagnostics doesn't
 * make kaval write heap snapshots too.
