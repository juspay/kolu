/** Typed channel registry for terminal + system events.
 *
 *  One `MemoryPublisher` instance, two named registries on top:
 *
 *    - `terminalChannels` — keyed-broadcast bus per `(channel, terminalId)`
 *      pair. Each entry is a `Channel<T>` from `@kolu/surface/server`,
 *      owning both publish AND subscribe for its named channel. Single
 *      source of truth for what events exist per terminal.
 *    - `terminalsDirtyChannel` — singleton control-flow signal that
 *      drives the session auto-save debounce loop. Distinct from the
 *      `terminalList` cell's content channel: this is the *trigger*,
 *      not the saved content.
 *
 *  Cell-level system channels (`preferences:changed`, `activity:changed`,
 *  `session:changed`, `terminal-list`) live in `./cells.ts`'s `cellBus`
 *  alongside the corresponding `Cell` descriptor — same one-bus-per-cell
 *  convention this file uses for the per-terminal axis.
