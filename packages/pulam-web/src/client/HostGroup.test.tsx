/**
 * The empty-vs-error RENDER GATE — the regression guard the whole PR exists for.
 *
 * #1564 was a RENDER lie: a dead backend↔remote mirror left awareness empty and
 * `HostGroup` painted "no terminals" beside a healthy-looking host. The fix gates
 * the terminal body on `effectiveHealth(status, connection).state === "connected"`
 * and renders an honest `ConnectionView` otherwise. `reserve.test.ts` pins the
 * cell VALUE reaching the browser; THIS pins what `HostGroup` actually RENDERS off
 * it — reverting the `<Show>` gate turns these red where the value test stays green.
 *
 * The harness mounts the REAL `HostGroup` (its real `effectiveHealth` fold, real
 * `<Show>` gates, real `ConnectionView`/`FailedCard`) under happy-dom, driving its
 * two inputs through a stand-in surface: the `connection` cell and the awareness
 * key set. The transport `status` is held LIVE so `effectiveHealth` keys off the
 * mirror cell — the leg under test — not a transport shadow.
