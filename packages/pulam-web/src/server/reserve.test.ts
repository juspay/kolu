/**
 * The R8b-relevant proof, hermetically: agent → mirror → re-serve → browser
 * store, end-to-end, with NO ssh and NO Nix.
 *
 * The whole pulam-web epic rests on one claim — kolu's browser-consumption leg
 * (websocketLink → surfaceClient → Solid reconcile) works against a re-served
 * mirror of a remote `terminalWorkspaceSurface`. This test pins that leg with
 * the transport collapsed to `directLink` (in-process), so the only thing under
 * test is the FOLD: does an awareness delta on the agent flow through
 * `mirrorRemoteSurface` → `buildReServe`'s sink → the re-serve fragment → a
 * Solid `surfaceClient` collection subscription, and does that subscription
 * RE-NOTIFY?
 *
 * The pipe, left to right:
 *
 *   1. A REAL agent surface (`implementSurface(terminalWorkspaceSurface, …)`),
 *      its awareness collection backed by a Map the test mutates. Seeded with
 *      terminal "A".
 *   2. An agent client over `directLink`.
 *   3. `mirrorRemoteSurface(surface, agentClient, makeSink(), {})` —
 *      drives `buildReServe`'s sink fold WITHOUT the session (the split the
 *      design exposes for exactly this: `makeSink` builds the sink directly, no
 *      client argument — forwarding reaches the live client via the holder).
 *   4. A SECOND client over `directLink` to the re-serve router, wrapped in a
 *      Solid `surfaceClient`, its `awareness.use({})` read inside `createRoot`.
 *
 * ASSERT #1: after the first snapshot, the browser store has key "A".
 * ASSERT #2: upsert "B" + remove "A" on the agent → the Solid subscription
 * re-notifies, keys become {B}. That re-notify is the proof.
