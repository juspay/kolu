/**
 * R8 — `useWatchedRead`: reconstruct a value-bearing reactive read from a
 * `terminalWorkspaceSurface` PROCEDURE + its change-PULSE watcher stream.
 *
 * R6 left kolu's fs/git as value-bearing streams on `koluSurface` (each yield a
 * full re-read). R8 deletes those and composes `terminalWorkspaceSurface`, whose
 * fs/git are PROCEDURES (request → response) plus `subscribeRepoChange` /
 * `subscribeFileChange` watcher streams that carry a payload-free `{seq}` PULSE.
 * The consumer's job — what this primitive does — is "subscribe to the pulse,
 * re-query the procedure on every pulse (including the `{seq:0}` snapshot frame)."
 * The result is the SAME ergonomic shape the old `app.streams.X.use(...)` gave
 * (`value()` / `.pending()` / `.error()`), so the Code-tab call sites barely move.
 *
 * Driven by an explicit `createEffect` (not `createResource`): the effect tracks
 * `input()` AND the `pulse()`, so each new pulse re-runs the read — and it stores
 * the outcome in plain signals, so a rejected read (e.g. `git ls-files` in a bare
 * repo) lands on `error()`/`onError` and NEVER throws on read. A resource would
 * re-throw on `value()` and surface as an uncaught page error (the old
 * value-bearing stream routed such failures to its `onError` instead).
 *
 * This is the concrete "not byte-identical — a one-time client update" cost the
 * R8 plan names: the wire shape changed (stream → procedure+pulse), so the client
 * gains this one adapter instead of reading a value-bearing stream directly.
