/**
 * HostDownCanvas — the Skew-UX "this host's padi failed to bind" surface.
 *
 * Distinct from `DegradedCanvas` (a CONNECTED host whose kaval daemon died, which
 * offers a Restart): this is the ACTIVE host's map-membership entry itself failing
 * — an ssh/contract-level fault the map reports as a TYPED {@link EntryFailedCause}.
 *
 * Two actions: **[Reconnect]** (the recovery verb — `hosts.reconnect` force-cycles
 * the held session into a fresh dial; a STANDING refuse holds degraded WITHOUT
 * auto-reconnecting, so once the operator clears the cause named in the copy, this
 * is the path back — it is a REAL re-dial, not the inert Retry we forbid on a
 * transient arm that already auto-retries) and **[Switch to local]** (the escape
 * hatch to the unremovable default). Each cause gets first-class plain-language copy
 * from the pure {@link hostDownCopy} map; this component wires that copy + the two
 * buttons into the shared {@link CanvasFailureCard} shell.
 *
 * `cause` + `reason` arrive as props from the resolved `host-failed` CanvasMode
 * (App.tsx reads them off the active entry's `state()`); the copy is looked up by
 * cause and the raw `reason` is shown verbatim as a small detail beneath it.
