/** Render-stall recovery — force a synchronous repaint when xterm's
 *  requestAnimationFrame-driven paint loop has stalled, and expose the
 *  render-pipeline state the Diagnostic Info dialog needs to prove it.
 *
 *  WHY THIS EXISTS (the freeze PRs #1235 and #1273 did NOT fix):
 *
 *  xterm's RenderService schedules every visible paint through ONE
 *  `window.requestAnimationFrame`, with no timer fallback. RenderDebouncer does
 *  `if (this._animationFrame) { return; }` and clears that handle ONLY inside
 *  the rAF callback (`_innerRefresh`). So when Chromium stops producing frames —
 *  a window OCCLUDED by another, e.g. you alt-tab away while an agent fleet runs
 *  (note: macOS/Linux app-switch keeps `document.visibilityState === 'visible'`,
 *  so this is NOT the `document.hidden` path `refitOnTabVisible` watches) — a
 *  pending rAF is never serviced. PTY output keeps arriving and parsing into the
 *  buffer (WriteBuffer's `setTimeout` is merely clamped under occlusion, not
 *  frozen), so every later write only widens the dirty range and hits the
 *  early-return: the screen stays on a stale frame. An input event (a keypress)
 *  forces a `BeginMainFrame` that finally services the parked rAF — which is why
 *  "press any key and it jumps to the latest" was the only known recovery.
 *
 *  Proven deterministically against the pinned @xterm/xterm beta: holding rAF
 *  while writing leaves `buffer.length` growing with ZERO `onRender` firings,
 *  and `_renderService.refreshRows(0, rows - 1, true)` (sync flag bypasses the
 *  debouncer) repaints to the LATEST without a serviced frame.
 *
 *  The fix forces that synchronous repaint on the signals that actually fire
 *  when the user returns to an occluded window. This module is the DOM-free
 *  core (so the node-env unit suite can drive it via injected `now`/`hasFocus`
 *  seams, the same shape `scrollLock` uses): it owns the watchdog and the
 *  forced paint. The one DOM signal — `window`'s `focus` event, which is what
 *  fires on app-switch return (NOT `visibilitychange`) — is wired in
 *  Terminal.tsx, the DOM-adjacent owner, calling `recover()`. Both triggers are
 *  cause-agnostic: they don't depend on WHY frames stopped and don't wait for
 *  the browser to produce one.
 *
 *  This module owns render-stall RECOVERY (the watchdog and the forced sync
 *  paint); the knowledge of xterm's private `_core` shape it depends on
 *  (`_renderService`, DEC private modes) lives in `xtermInternals.ts`, the one
 *  null-guarded home for every `_core.*` reach. So a future beta that renames
 *  those fields degrades to a no-op forceRepaint + "unknown" probes instead of
 *  crashing — and is fixed in exactly one place.
