/** Stale-terminal predicate. Pure temporal: a terminal is "stale" when its

 *  selected activity window. Agent state is NOT consulted — identity for
 *  stale-but-still-awaiting agents is preserved at the *render* layer
 *  (`QuietRowBody` paints `AgentIndicator` when `meta.agent` is set), not
 *  by exempting them from staleness.
 *
 *  `lastActivityAt` is bumped only on agent semantic-key transitions
 *  (`packages/server/src/meta/agent.ts`), so terminals that never hosted an
 *  agent stay at `0` and are excluded — staleness only applies to terminals
 *  whose attention state has actually been observed at some point.
 *
 *  The active threshold flows from `activityWindowThresholdMs()` in
 *  `activityWindow.ts` — a per-device persisted choice exposed through
 *  one signal so every consumer (dock buckets, minimap fade, badge gate)
 *  agrees on what "stale" means. */
