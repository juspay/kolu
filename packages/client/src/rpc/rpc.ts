/**
 * Server lifecycle: connecting / connected / disconnected / reconnected /
 * restarted, plus the facets (transport status, server process identity) kolu's
 * UI reads. The derivation itself is NOT hand-rolled here — it's
 * `@kolu/surface-app/solid`'s `createServerLifecycle`, the encapsulated form of
 * what this file used to re-derive (the `surfaceApp.info` probe on every WebSocket
 * open, comparing the returned process UUID against the last-known one to tell a
 * transient drop from a restart). This module is just the kolu-shaped, module-
 * level signal layer above it: it wires the library to kolu's transport
 * (`ws`) and probe (`surface.surfaceApp.identity.info`, surface-app's identity
 * surface served as a sibling) and re-exports the facets under the names kolu's
 * call sites already use.
 *
 * Transport setup (PartySocket, typed oRPC client) lives in `../wire.ts`.
