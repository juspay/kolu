/**
 * Pure logic for the `send` subcommand — turn the text/keys a caller passes into
 * the exact byte writes that reach the PTY, with no I/O or transport so it is
 * unit-testable without a socket. `main.ts` is the thin glue that resolves the
 * id, reads stdin, issues `terminal.write` for each planned chunk, and prints.
 *
 * `send` writes EXACTLY what the caller asked for — the literal text, plus any
 * explicit `--key`s — and nothing more. It does NOT append a submit Enter on its
 * own: a prompt is sent only when you say so, with `kaval-tui send <id> --key
 * Enter`. Keeping submit explicit avoids two traps an implicit Enter fell into:
 * it's invisible magic the caller can't time, and against Claude Code's
 * bracketed-paste / debounced input it raced the paste and was silently dropped —
 * so `send` would report success while the prompt sat staged, unsubmitted. Make
 * submitting its own `send --key Enter` (a separate write, after the text has
 * settled) and the race is gone too.
 *
 * The one transformation `send` does apply is BRACKETED PASTE for multiline or
 * piped-stdin text: the agent's input box takes it as ONE block instead of
 * submitting line-by-line (each `\n` would otherwise fire a half-written prompt).
 * It is auto — on for multiline / stdin, off for a single-line argument — and
 * `--paste` / `--no-paste` force it; the `paste` field of the result makes it
 * visible, never silent.
