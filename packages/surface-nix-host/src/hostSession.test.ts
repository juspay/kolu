/**
 * Regression coverage for two failure paths through `spawn()`, both of
 * which short-circuit before any ssh child is created:
 *
 *   1. "Reconnect does nothing" — when the link gives up because
 *      `nix copy --derivation` provisioning failed, `spawn()` throws
 *      before any child exists, so `handleChildDone` (the usual site that
 *      nulls `clientPromise`) never runs. If the terminal `failed`
 *      transition doesn't clear the slot itself, it keeps the last
 *      *rejected* spawn promise, and `reconnect()`'s `clientPromise !==
 *      null` guard makes the "Reconnect" button a silent no-op. See
 *      `clearClientPromise` / `scheduleReconnect`.
 *
 *   2. "Unreachable host keeps retrying" — the `.drv` resolver (typically
 *      an ssh arch probe, deferred into `resolveDrvPath`) rejects because
 *      the host is unreachable. This is a `"network"` fault: the session
 *      must (a) flow through its own reconnect machinery rather than throw
 *      out of construction — keeping one unreachable initial host from
 *      crashing the parent server before any session exists — and (b)
 *      *never* give up, so a roaming laptop reconnects on its own once the
 *      host is reachable again, instead of stranding in terminal `failed`.
 *
 * Both keep off real ssh / `nix copy`: case 1 mocks `provisionAgent` to
 * fail; case 2's resolver rejects before `provisionAgent` is ever reached.
