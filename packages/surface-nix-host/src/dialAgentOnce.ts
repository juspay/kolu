/**
 * `dialAgentOnce<C>` — the one-shot CLI dial: provision a Nix-shipped surface
 * agent on a remote host over ssh and hand back a `{ client, dispose }` with the
 * link already proven live. This is the missing receptacle that sat one step
 * short of the socket every `--host` consumer needs: `HostSession` owns the
 * HARD volatility (ssh/reconnect/provision), but each CLI was re-wiring the same
 * composition on top of it — env-var parse, arch-probe + drv lookup, and the
 * pin → probe → markConnected → leak-safe-destroy lifecycle. That composition is
 * a single primitive; it lives here, once.
 *
 * A CLI supplies only its genuinely-volatile values: the binary name, the
 * already-read drv-map JSON (the env-var NAME stays in the caller, since the
 * Nix-wrapper boundary spells it per-agent), and a noun for the "no derivation
 * baked" error. Proving the link is the framework's job, not the CLI's: the dial
 * defaults to the reserved `system.live` round-trip (`probeSurfaceLive`) — the
 * same receptacle HostSession's periodic watchdog plugs into — so no CLI
 * nominates its own liveness verb. A CLI overrides `probe` only for a protocol
 * assertion that goes beyond liveness (pulam-tui's `version` first-frame check).
 *
 * This is the *one-shot* shape: it fires `markConnected()` itself and discards
 * the `HostSession`, because a one-shot CLI needs no copying/connecting overlay
 * and never reads `onState`. A long-lived consumer that wants the session's
 * `onState`/`markConnected` seam composes its own variant carrying `session`
 * (as mini-ci's dialer does) — it does NOT reuse this `{ client, dispose }`.
