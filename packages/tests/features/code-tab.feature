Feature: Code tab (review + browse)
  The Code tab is one Pierre file tree with three modes:
    - All (browse)   — full repo, file content on selection
    - Local          — working tree vs HEAD, diff on selection
    - Branch         — working tree vs merge-base(origin/<default>), diff on selection
  The tree, diff viewer, and file viewer are all owned by `@pierre/trees`
  and `@pierre/diffs` (PR #708). This feature exercises the data flow,
  selection, mode transitions, and the right-click affordances the Pierre
  wrappers expose to copy paths and line refs.

  Background:
    Given the terminal is ready
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should be visible

  # ── Tab presence + chrome ──

  Scenario: Code tab is present and switchable
    When I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should be active

  Scenario: Shows "not a git repo" message outside a repo
    When I run "cd /tmp"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should indicate no git repository

  Scenario: Shows "no changes" when the repo is clean
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-clean && cd /tmp/kolu-review-clean"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the empty-changes message

  # ── Mode picker ──

  Scenario: Mode toggle defaults to Local
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-toggle && cd /tmp/kolu-review-toggle"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab mode should be "local"

  Scenario: Code tab mode survives panel close and reopen
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-mode-persist && cd /tmp/kolu-review-mode-persist"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should not be visible
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should be visible
    And the Code tab mode should be "browse"

  # ── Local mode: file list + diff rendering ──

  Scenario: Lists changed files and opens a diff on click
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-dirty && cd /tmp/kolu-review-dirty"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'hello\n' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "note.txt"
    When I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should render a diff view

  # Validates the chokidar-backed live update path: a file written
  # AFTER the Code tab is open must appear without any manual refresh.
  # The write happens out-of-band (`the file system creates …`) because
  # opening the Code tab moves keyboard focus to the panel UI — at that
  # point `I run` keystrokes would land on the panel, not the PTY.
  # `rm -rf` first so a stale dir from a prior run doesn't carry
  # untracked files into the empty-changes assertion.
  Scenario: Live updates surface files written after opening the Code tab
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-review-live && git init /tmp/kolu-review-live && cd /tmp/kolu-review-live"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the empty-changes message
    When the file system creates "after\n" at "/tmp/kolu-review-live/live.txt"
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "live.txt"

  # Validates that editing an EXISTING tracked file (chokidar `change`
  # event, no path-set change) still flips the file into Local mode's
  # changed list — the watcher's empty-delta event must propagate so the
  # client refetches `git.status`.
  Scenario: Live updates surface modifications to already-tracked files
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-review-modify && git init /tmp/kolu-review-modify && cd /tmp/kolu-review-modify"
    And I run "printf 'one\n' > tracked.txt && git add tracked.txt && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the empty-changes message
    When the file system appends "two\n" to "/tmp/kolu-review-modify/tracked.txt"
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "tracked.txt"

  Scenario: Untracked files appear alongside modified tracked files
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-untracked && cd /tmp/kolu-review-untracked"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'initial\n' > tracked.txt && git add tracked.txt && git commit -m 'add tracked'"
    And I run "printf 'modified\n' > tracked.txt"
    And I run "printf 'new\n' > untracked.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "tracked.txt"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "untracked.txt"

  # ── Pierre tree behaviour: directory grouping + collapse ──

  Scenario: Groups files into a directory tree
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-tree && cd /tmp/kolu-review-tree"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "mkdir -p src/components && printf 'a\n' > src/index.ts && printf 'b\n' > src/components/Button.tsx"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show a directory node "src"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "src/index.ts"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "src/components/Button.tsx"

  Scenario: Collapsing a directory hides its children
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-collapse && cd /tmp/kolu-review-collapse"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "mkdir -p pkg && printf 'x\n' > pkg/a.ts && printf 'y\n' > pkg/b.ts"
    And I click the Code tab

    When I click the directory node "pkg" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should not list a changed file "pkg/a.ts"
    When I click the directory node "pkg" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "pkg/a.ts"

    And I run "mkdir -p src && printf 'a\n' > README.md && printf 'b\n' > src/index.ts"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    And the file browser should show a directory "src"
    And the file browser should show a file "README.md"

  Scenario: File browser shows file content on click
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-content && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-content"

    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the file browser should show a directory "lib"
    When I click the directory "lib" in the file browser
    Then the file browser should show a file "lib/util.ts"

  # ── Pierre file/diff viewer right-click menu (Copy path:line) ──

  Scenario: Right-click on file content with a selected line copies "path:line"
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-ctx && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-ctx"
    And I run "printf 'alpha\nbeta\ngamma\n' > letters.txt"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "letters.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file content should contain "beta"
    When I click the line number 2 in the file content
    And I right-click the file content
    And I click the context menu item "Copy letters.txt:2"
    Then the clipboard should contain "letters.txt:2"

  # Regression: switching diff files used to break the "Copy path:line"
  # context-menu entry. Two interleaved causes — first, a `<Match>` callback
  # in CodeTab captured `selectedPath()` to a `const`, freezing the path
  # prop fed into `<PierreDiffView>`. Second, even after the path was made
  # reactive, Pierre's `FileDiff.render(newFileDiff)` reuses the same
  # instance and its line-selection handlers don't re-bind to the fresh
  # gutter elements — so right-clicks on the second file's lines yielded a
  # menu with no "Copy path:line" entry at all (range stayed null because
  # no `onLineSelected` ever fired). Fix: key the diff/browse subtree on
  # path so each file gets a fresh `FileDiff` and a clean
  # `useLineSelection` range.
  Scenario: Switching diff files keeps the "Copy path:line" entry in sync
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-diff-multifile && cd /tmp/kolu-diff-multifile"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'a-one\na-two\na-three\n' > file-a.txt"
    And I run "printf 'b-one\nb-two\nb-three\n' > file-b.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "file-a.txt"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "file-b.txt"
    When I click the changed file "file-a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "a-one"
    When I click the line number 1 in the diff view
    And I right-click the diff view
    And I click the context menu item "Copy file-a.txt:1"
    Then the clipboard should contain "file-a.txt:1"
    When I click the changed file "file-b.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "b-one"
    When I click the line number 1 in the diff view
    And I right-click the diff view
    Then the context menu items should be "Copy path | Copy file-b.txt:1"
    When I click the context menu item "Copy file-b.txt:1"
    Then the clipboard should contain "file-b.txt:1"
    And the clipboard should not contain "file-a.txt"
