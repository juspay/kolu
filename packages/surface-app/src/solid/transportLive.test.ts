/**
 * R1 — the liveness leg of the health FACT is REAL, not a constant `true`.
 *
 * `connectSurface` threads the socket's reactive transport `status` into
 * `surfaceClient`'s `live` option (`{ live: () => status() === "live" }`), so a
 * `down`/`reconnecting` transport flips `health().live` to `false` and a gate
 * reads `connecting` rather than a confident `ready` over a dead socket. The
 * pre-fix code dropped `live` to its default constant `true` — the exact
 * green-dot-over-a-dead-link lie, one level up, in the very primitive built to
 * end it.
 *
 * This drives the SAME `createSocketStatus` accessor `connectSurface` builds
 * (over the fake open/close socket `socketStatus.test.ts` uses), threaded into a
 * real `surfaceClient` by the SAME predicate, and asserts `health().live` tracks
 * the transport — NOT a hand-toggled boolean. A live partysocket flakes in a
 * Node unit test (see `connect.test.ts`), so the socket is faked at its two
 * observable events; everything else — the status derivation and the live fold —
 * is the real production code.
