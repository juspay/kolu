/**
 * `connectSurface` — the turnkey client seam for a SINGLE surface over one
 * reconnecting socket, with the liveness watchdog wired in BY DEFAULT.
 *
 * This is the no-lifecycle counterpart to `createServerLifecycle`: an app with
 * no shared connection-status UI driven off the socket — pulam-web's per-host
 * fleet sockets, drishti's per-host sockets — builds its reactive client AND its
 * half-open watchdog in one call, instead of hand-rolling `createSurfaceSocket`
 * → `createLiveSignal` → `surfaceClient` (the steps every such app FORGOT — the
 * watchdog, and threading its handle). The heartbeat is default-on and probes the
 * framework-reserved `system.live` round-trip (`@kolu/surface/liveness`), so it
 * needs no app-supplied probe — there is no probe left for an app to forget.
 *
 * An app that DOES drive shared connection-status UI off the socket (kolu's
 * header dot) derives a `createServerLifecycle` instead — which folds the SAME
 * watchdog in — and builds its own (possibly multi-sibling) clients over the
 * combined link. So an app that reaches for either of the two seams gets the
 * liveness watchdog BY DEFAULT — there is no probe to forget. (A consumer that
 * hand-builds the raw seam, like a minimal example, calls `createLiveSignal(ws)`
 * itself and passes the WHOLE handle to `surfaceClient(surface, transport)` — that
 * is the only hand-built path, since handing `surfaceClient` a bare `websocketLink`
 * THROWS, and the branded handle can't be obtained any other way. The seams exist so
 * it doesn't have to wire the socket + client + watchdog by hand.)
