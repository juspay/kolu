/**
 * @kolu/surface-mcp — re-expose any `@kolu/surface` as an MCP server.
 *
 * A generic adapter generalizing odu's hand-built `src/mcp/` face. The public
 * surface is small and default-deny: declare what an agent may touch via
 * `expose` (+ optional bespoke `tools`), hand it a live-surface `client`
 * factory, and `serveSurfaceAsMcp` builds the low-level MCP `Server` — the
 * subscribe/teardown lifecycle, the zod→JSON-Schema bridge, and the
 * resource/tool wiring are the package's.
